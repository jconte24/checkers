Transmission string formats for CLIENT TO CLIENT communication.
	n.b. underscores and brackets are not included in actual strings, they are here in the example to make things appear organized.
	
All of these data strings will begin with: [a]_[bcd]_[e]_[...] 

where: [a] = "c", [bcd] = id of the current player (sending the data), and [e] will equal one of several chars as specified by StringFormats.txt. They are below for refernece:
	n.b. some [e] commands are not present because they are not relevent. e.g. "t" is not here because TransmitData handles termination for you, so no need to use it.
	
	[e]--> code for client/server interaction
		| = "n"-->new opponent 	(both command)				requests new opponent/reports new opponent
		| = "o"-->opponent inquiry (both command)			sent to server to see whether or not calling client has an opponent
		| = "i"-->initialize client. (client command)		this is sent to client so that it can take the [bcd] id and associate it with itself 
		| = "c"-->command. (both command)					Means that the string contains client data and should be passed directly to a client. 
		| = "d"-->disconnected (server command)				Server informs client that client has been disconnected from opponent.
		| = "f"-->fetch data (server command)				requests data from the server's queue (for a particular client)


where: [e] = "c" --> [e]_[ghi]_[f]_[...]
	[f] --> code for the type of message one client is sending to another
		| = "m"--> move			client is making an ordinary move and is informing opponent
		| = "j"--> jump			client is making a jump and is informing opponent
	[ghi]-> id of opponent that message is being sent to.
	
	
	where: [f] = "m" --> [f]_[jk]_[lm]
		[jk] --> beginning coordinates 
		[lm] --> new coordinates
		
		e.g. --> "c 000 c 001 m 33 44" means that your opponent (000) has moved from [3][3] to [4][4].
		
	where: [f] = "j" --> [f]_[jk]_[lm]_[n]
		[jk] --> beginning coordinates 
		[lm] --> new coordinates
		[n] ---> whether or not that is one's final jump
			| = "t" --> true		indicates that opponent has no more jumps and it is your turn again
			| = "f" --> false		means that opponent is going to double/tripple/etc jump and it's still his turn.
		
			e.g. --> "c 000 c 001 j 33 51 t" means that your opponent (000) has moved from [3][3] to [5][1], and after a little math, you can conclude that your piece at [4][2] has been jumped. "t" means it's your turn.
